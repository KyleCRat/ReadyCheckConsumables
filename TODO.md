## Bugfix
- Ready count at top left of title bar in RaidFrame shows 0/2 when the person who initated the readycheck always has 1 check.
- Ready count at top left of title bar in RaidFrame shows 3/2 when readycheck finishes with only 2 people in group and 1 is offline

## Features
- Let's change the icon for ready check for offline and dead players
  - Offline should be a disconnect icon
  - Dead should be a gravestone icon
- When everyone is ready the 0/x Ready check counter should change to the text "Everyone is Ready"
